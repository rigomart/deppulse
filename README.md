**Why it exists**: If you need a dependency for a long-term project, you should know if it's actively maintained. Stars, good docs and downloads lie. A project can look healthy on paper while maintainers haven't touched it in months.

**How it works**: Enter a GitHub repository → Deppulse fetches recent activity data → You get a risk category with the evidence behind it.
